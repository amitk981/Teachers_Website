One of the biggest challenges students face in CBSE History is remembering important dates. Here are proven techniques I teach my students to make date memorization easy and effective.

## Why Dates Matter in CBSE History

CBSE Board exams often have 2-3 questions directly asking for dates. Additionally, writing correct dates in answers shows examiner that you know the topic well and can fetch extra marks.

## Top 5 Techniques for Remembering Dates

### 1. Create Stories Around Dates

Instead of memorizing "1857 - First War of Independence" as standalone facts, create a story:

> "In 1857, soldiers were **18** to **57** years old when they revolted!"

This silly connection makes the date stick.

### 2. Group Related Events

Group events by decade:
- **1920s**: Non-Cooperation Movement (1920), Chauri Chaura (1922)
- **1930s**: Salt March (1930), Quit India planned
- **1940s**: Quit India (1942), Independence (1947)

### 3. Use Number Patterns

Notice patterns in dates:
- 1905, 1915, 1925 - What happened in each?
- 1919, 1929, 1939 - Key events a decade apart

### 4. Connect to Personal Numbers

Link dates to numbers you already know:
- Your birth year
- Your phone number digits
- Your house number

### 5. Create a Timeline Wall

Draw a timeline on a long paper and stick it on your wall. Add events as you study. Visual repetition helps!

## Must-Know Dates for Class 10

Remember: Understanding the WHY behind events helps you remember WHEN they happened. Don't just memorize - understand the story of India's freedom struggle!

Good luck! 🏛️📚
