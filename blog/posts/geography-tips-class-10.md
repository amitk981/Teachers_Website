Scoring 90+ in CBSE Class 10 Geography is absolutely achievable with the right strategy. After teaching 500+ students at Army Public School, I've seen what works and what doesn't. Here are my top 10 tips:

## 1. Master the NCERT Textbook

CBSE questions come directly from NCERT. Read every line carefully, including captions under maps and diagrams. Don't skip the "Activities" sections - examiners love pulling questions from there.

## 2. Practice Maps Daily

Map work carries 5 marks but is the easiest scoring opportunity. Practice locating places, rivers, mountains, and industries daily. Make it a 10-minute habit before studying other topics.

## 3. Create Chapter-wise Flowcharts

For chapters like "Resources and Development" or "Manufacturing Industries", create flowcharts showing classifications. Visual memory is stronger than text memory.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Use different colored pens for different categories. For example, use blue for water resources, green for forest resources, and brown for mineral resources.

## 4. Understand, Don't Memorize

Instead of memorizing that "black soil is good for cotton", understand WHY (moisture retention, iron content). This helps you answer application-based questions.

## 5. Write Point-wise Answers

For 3-mark and 5-mark questions, always write in points with proper numbering. Examiners can quickly identify your key points and award marks easily.

## 6. Learn to Draw Simple Diagrams

A simple diagram of the water cycle, soil profile, or manufacturing process can add 0.5-1 extra mark. Keep them neat and labeled.

## 7. Solve Previous Year Papers

Last 5 years' papers show you the question pattern. You'll notice certain topics are repeated. Focus extra attention on those high-frequency topics.

## 8. Connect Chapters

Resources, Agriculture, Industries, and Transport are all connected. When you see these connections, you'll remember facts better and write integrated answers.

## 9. Time Your Practice

Geography paper is often rushed in the exam. Practice writing answers within time limits: 2 minutes for 1-mark, 4 minutes for 3-mark, 6 minutes for 5-mark.

## 10. Revise Weekly

Don't wait until exams to revise. Every Sunday, spend 30 minutes reviewing what you learned that week. This spaced repetition works magic for long-term memory.

**Remember:** Consistency beats intensity. Study a little every day, practice maps regularly, and understand concepts deeply. You CAN score 90+ in Geography!

Good luck with your preparation! 🌍📚
